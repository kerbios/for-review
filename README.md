# Test task chat with websockets and react, redux

## Instrcustion

To send the messages into the channel you need to Login 

## Notes

My intention was to show that I can work with connect and hooks, with promises and asyc/await 
In real project I prefer to have some consistency of code and style agreement in team.

## Lack of time:
- preload messages in chunks wasn't implemented, but all messages are stored in persistance storage.
- ui design of bottom bar as well, need to make it fixed to bottom.
- no tests ...
